# K_means
a basic implementation of k-nearest-neighbors

This project is a build week for Lambda School Computer Science Unit 1. It was completed durring the week of May 25th. 

### Monday

I choose to do this implimentation because as a part of my labs project I needed to cluster earthquakes but was unable to get the sklearn implimentaiton to work for me. I'm going to check in tomorrow (Tuesday) if I can build an algorithm that is specific to my project instead of just recreating the base model.

Today I'm going to focus on getting the general structure of the class built. MVP lays out required methods and I'm going to get those in place.
